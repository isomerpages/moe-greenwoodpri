Warmest greetings from the Greenwood family!

Greenwood Primary School recently celebrated her 21st Anniversary. Over the past decades, we have witnessed the growth of the school and celebrated many milestones and achievements. The successes of the school could only be possible because of the dedicated and mission-centred staff as well as the strong support of our School Advisory Committee, parents, partners, and the community, over the years.

Our school is like a home to both our staff and students - a place where we _learn and grow_ together. Indeed, this idea of _learning and growth_ is aptly captured in the young shoot in our school crest that represents the continual growth of the school community through learning together. In line with _Learn for Life_, we believe that every child can learn.  In Greenwood, we hope to develop and grow our students holistically by creating engaging and joyful everyday learning experiences, both within and beyond the classrooms.  

A young shoot starts as a seed, analogous to every child who passes through the portals of Greenwood Primary. Like a seed that requires a conducive environment and essential conditions to grow, every child would need the care, support and encouragement to grow and thrive. With the right conditions, a seed will grow into a young shoot, and eventually into a plant or tree that will bear fruit.  Likewise, it is our desire that our children will grow in character, knowledge and wisdom. Together with my team, we aspire to provide the right conditions and learning environment to teach, guide and nurture our students to be _motivated learners_, _critical thinkers_ and _leaders of character_ who exemplify our school's WEGR2Ow values of _wisdom, empathy, graciousness, resilience, responsibility_ and _open-mindedness_.  

I look forward to partnering you to bring out the best in our children as we prepare them to navigate the future with confidence, grit and wisdom.  

_Guidance to Wisdom_

Partnering you in education,

**Mrs Tricilia Chua  
Principal**
