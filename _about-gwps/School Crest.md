The school logo is visual representation of our school’s motto, values, vision and mission.

The young shoot encompasses the notion of continual growth and the surge towards learning. 

It also encapsulates the spirit of vigour and vibrancy.  

The symbol of the young shoot growing from the school’s name ‘Greenwood’ signifies the idea of nurturing individuals.  

The logo signifies the pro-active and committed role of the school to be the ‘Guidance to Wisdom’ to all individuals.
