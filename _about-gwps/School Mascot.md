# School Mascot

The idea of having a school’s mascot was conceptualized in late 2003. Greenwood Primary was looking for an entity which the school could associate it with and is synonymous to. Since the owl is part of Greenwood’s logo, the idea of an owl mascot was mooted.

There was an art competition held for pupils to come up with the best owl concept. The selection went through several processes and finally the owl drafted by Casmelin Nah was turned into an owl beanie.

The owl mascot was sent in for ‘reproduction’ in time for the Greenwood’s Official Opening on 22nd May, 2004 .
