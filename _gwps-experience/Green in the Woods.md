### **<center>GREEN in the Woods (Gracious, Responsible & Environmentally Engaged in the Woods)</center>**

The GREEN in the Woods programme seeks to establish and sustain a positive environmental culture through encouraging and practising environmentally responsible behaviour in the aspect of 4Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle and Replace).

Throughout the year, key programmes and innovations are planned and organised to shape the beliefs of students and staff on the importance of protecting the environment. Our programmes focus on student-led initiatives and student involvement in green movement activities such as recycling projects, food waste reduction, lessons in green spaces, dengue education, water and electricity conservation, and commemorative events such as Earth Day and World Water Day.

In addition, our students also participate actively in outreach programmes organised by external agencies such as Northwest CDC, NEA and NParks. Partnership with the community gives them an opportunity to engage and work collaboratively with others to conserve our environment and create environmental awareness. Accreditations from the Northwest CDC, Singapore Environment Council, Building and Constructions Authority (BCA) and World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) have affirmed the school’s good practices.
