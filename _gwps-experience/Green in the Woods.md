<h4><strong>Community Outreach</strong></h4><strong>
<p>Green in the Woods is dedicated to fostering community engagement and
sustainability through innovative practices and early education. By collaborating
with the Residents' Committee (RC), we distribute the produce from our
school's hydroponics system, providing fresh, healthy vegetables to local
residents while educating our students on sustainable farming practices.
Additionally, we work with local preschools to instill the values of sustainability
from an early age through interactive workshops and hands-on projects that
teach young children about recycling, conserving resources, and protecting
nature. These initiatives not only strengthen community bonds but also
lay a strong foundation for sustainable practices in the youngest members
of our community. Through these collaborations, we are building a culture
of sustainability, ensuring that the next generation is well-equipped to
contribute to a greener and more resilient future.</p>
