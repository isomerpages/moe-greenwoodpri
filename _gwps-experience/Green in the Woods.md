<h4><strong>Community Outreach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Green in the Woods is dedicated to fostering community engagement and sustainability through innovative practices and early education. By collaborating with the Residents' Committee (RC), we distribute the produce from our school's hydroponics system, providing fresh, healthy vegetables to local residents while educating our students on sustainable farming practices. Additionally, we work with local preschools to instill the values of sustainability from an early age through interactive workshops and hands-on projects that teach young children about recycling, conserving resources, and protecting nature. These initiatives not only strengthen community bonds but also lay a strong foundation for sustainable practices in the youngest members of our community. Through these collaborations, we are building a culture of sustainability, ensuring that the next generation is well-equipped to contribute to a greener and more resilient future.</strong>
