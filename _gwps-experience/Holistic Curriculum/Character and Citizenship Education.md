<h3><center><strong>Vision</strong></center></h3>
<p></p><center>Citizens of good character who are rooted to Singapore<p></p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To nurture responsible citizens who are leaders of character.</p></center>
<h4><strong><center>Key Programmes</center></strong></h4>
<p><strong>CCE in the Woods (CIW)</strong>
</p>
<p>CIW is our school-based values-curriculum developed to educate students
on values and self-leadership skills with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People as a foundation. The CIW package consists of activity sheets, buzz
time and students’ reflection on our school values and the 7 habits.</p>
<p>Through the use Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the Four Player Model and Systems
Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking
and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical
in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will self-assess on their progress in demonstrating
our school values using the CIW Reflection. Thereafter, teachers will provide
their input and feedback to support our students’ character development.</p>

<p><strong>National Education (NE) Commemorative Days</strong>
</p>
<p>In Greenwood Primary School, we commemorate the Total Defence Day (TDD),
International Friendship Day (IFD), Racial Harmony Day (RHD), and National
Day through fun, engaging, yet meaningful activities. During NE Commemorative
Days, students learn about the important milestones of Singapore’s history
and how they can continue to maintain Singapore as a diverse, unified and
resilient country.</p>

<p><strong>Museum-Based Learning (MBL)</strong>
</p>
<p>MBL (CCE and Social Studies field-based learning) at various museums and
heritage institutions allow students to understand the history and heritage
of Singapore and the region; appreciate the contributions by the ethnic
communities towards the development of our nation; and strengthen national
identity, build a sense of belonging and pride in the nation.</p>
<p>The programme includes the Primary 4 students visiting Geylang Serai Heritage
Gallery and Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery. Primary 5 students visiting Indian
Heritage Centre; and Primary 6 students visiting the Asian Civilisations
Museum.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>In nurturing our students to be Leaders of Character, VIA provides them
with opportunities to contribute to society. We believe that every student,
no matter how young, can contribute to society. Students have opportunities
to learn and care about Singapore, demonstrate active citizenship, learn
skills and values related to working in groups and interacting with others
in the public sphere besides serving the needs of the community in a variety
of ways.</p>
<p>As part of Everyday Responsibilities, students develop a sense of responsibility
and care for their own shared spaces through daily cleaning (Clean in the
Woods) and adopting sustainable practices in school and at home.</p>
<p>VIA Projects in Greenwood Primary, focuses on the three areas of Awareness,
Action and Advocacy, aimed at improving the well-being of the community.
Students plan and execute a VIA project, which is integrated with Project
Work (PW).</p>
<p>Students in Primary 1, 2 and 3 work on ways to contribute by raising awareness
on issues that matter to them. An example would be the use of food journaling
and documenting the family memories through food. Entries created by our
Primary 1 and 2 students will contribute to the national archival of our
memories - NLB Contemporary Collection. Primary 3 students apply inventive
thinking as they work on reimagining and designing spaces in the school
to make them more conducive for everyone. Students in Primary 4, take action
by contributing to the community around them. They apply inventive thinking
as they design games or toys which can then be submitted for competitions,
as well as during our annual Celebrating OWLETS event which serves as a
platform for social entrepreneurship. Primary 5 students take action by
increasing awareness of the health benefits of eating mushrooms with our
partner Golden Cap Farm, promoting healthy eating and sustainability efforts
among elderly and preschoolers with our elderly care centre and preschool
centre partners.</p>
<p>Our students become Leaders of Character as they influence and shape the
thinking of others as they work with external stakeholders such as the
elderly care centres and preschools in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>With the revised Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) scoring system
and diversity of secondary education pathways, students need to be guided
to make informed school choices while considering their values, strengths,
interests, and skills. ECG experiences in Primary schools (e.g., secondary
school talks, career talks) are opportunities to build our students’ self-awareness
and knowledge of the different education and career pathways. Such experiences
would be especially valuable for our students who are in their primary
school years, which are a time for growth and discovery.</p>
<p>We also believe that ECG enables our students to develop a sense of purpose
in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong
learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability, and
a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the
value of all occupations.</p>
<p>ECG lessons are taught during CCE FTGP periods during class discussions,
activities, and self-directed learning via Student Learning Spaces (SLS)
and the exploration of MySkillsFuture portal. ECG lessons have the following
goals:</p>
<p><u>Discovering Purpose – Who am I?</u>
</p>
<p>Nurture students' self-awareness to support them in discovering how they
can meaningfully play a part in their community.</p>
<p><u>Exploring Opportunities – Where do I want to go?</u>
</p>
<p>Develop students' self- directedness and confidence to explore and leverage
education and career opportunities while respecting the value of all occupations.</p>
<p><u>Staying Relevant - How do I get there?</u>
</p>
<p>Build students' adaptability and resilience to embrace the need for lifelong
learning.</p>
<p>On top of ECG lessons during CCE FTGP, we have created authentic experiences
for our students where we invited staff and partners to share on their
roles and responsibilities. An example would be during the commemoration
of Total Defence Day (15 February) where staff from Uniformed Services
such as SAF and SPF donned their uniforms and shared on what their respective
roles entails to raise awareness and spark interest in our students. We
also invited officers from SPF to showcase the equipment that they use
to keep Singapore safe.</p>
