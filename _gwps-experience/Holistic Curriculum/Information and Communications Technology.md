**Home-based Learning**  

Home-based Learning (HBL) is conducted for all levels of pupils to develop the pupils’ independent learning skills . On HBL days, all pupils will be assigned HBL lessons and assignments, primarily on the Student Learning Space (SLS) Learning Portal [(https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login). The SLS is an MOE learning portal that has curriculum-aligned learning resources catering to the needs of all learners.
