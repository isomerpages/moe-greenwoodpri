<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Achieving&nbsp;excellence through an ICT enriched environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mission&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>To nurture a community of responsible ICT users who embrace self-directed
and collaborative learning. &nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>ICT Integration in Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The school integrates ICT into the curriculum to enhance teaching and
learning experiences, strengthening studentsâ€™ digital literacy and technological
skills. ICT devices such as laptops and tablets are regularly used in classrooms
to facilitate engaging and interactive lessons, while online resources
and technological tools support differentiated learning tailored to individual
student needs. Computational Thinking and Coding are introduced early,
fostering problem-solving skills and creativity. The school also emphasizes
cyber wellness, teaching students to navigate the digital world responsibly
and safely. Through this learning approach, we aim to prepare our students
to be future ready learners and innovators.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Home-based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Home-based Learning (HBL) is conducted for all levels of pupils to ensure
continuity of education and encourage self-directed learning even outside
the classroom. On HBL days, all pupils will be assigned HBL lessons and
assignments, primarily on the Student Learning Space (SLS) Learning Portal
and Google Classroom. This provides students with a rich blend of synchronous
and asynchronous learning experiences. To foster holistic development,
HBL activities also incorporate a balanced mix of knowledge acquisition,
creative projects and exposure to the Arts.</p>
