**Cyber Wellness Programme**

Knowing that the students are digital natives, the school emphasises educating the students on cyber wellness to guide them in protecting themselves in the cyber world and being responsible users of these technologies. MOE uses the Cyber Wellness framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to, will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions. 

  

Cyber wellness activities and assembly programmes are specially planned by the cyber wellness student ambassadors to bring about an awareness of these principles to their peers.  The cyber wellness messages are also infused into CareIN lessons, where students will deepen their learning through classroom discussion and authentic real-life applications.

**Home-based Learning**  

Home-based Learning (HBL) is conducted for all levels of pupils to develop the pupils’ independent learning skills . On HBL days, all pupils will be assigned HBL lessons and assignments, primarily on the Student Learning Space (SLS) Learning Portal [(https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login). The SLS is an MOE learning portal that has curriculum-aligned learning resources catering to the needs of all learners.
