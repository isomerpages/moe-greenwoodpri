### <center>Vision</center>

<center>Confident Thinkers, Competent and Excellent Problem Solvers</center>

### <center>Mission</center>

<center>To instil in students the love for Mathematics and help them attain a level of mastery in problem-solving skills that will serve them well in life.</center>


**<center>Learning Experiences in the classrooms</center>** 
In Greenwood, students learn Mathematics in a fun and interactive manner so that they become confident and life-long learners of the subject. We believe that students must have opportunities to hone their reasoning and communication skills in their Mathematics classrooms. This is achieved by providing students with Learning Experiences that allows them to:  

1)Experience Early Success  

2)Build a Strong Foundation

3)Make Steady Progress

Strategies adopted by the department to provide an engaging learning experiences:
  
<center>a) Learning through Games</center>

**<center>Heuristics in the Woods using STAR Strategy</center>**

Heuristics in the Woods is an innovative teaching and learning resource that Greenwood teachers and students created. This resource makes use of stories and animation to teach heuristics in an exciting way. It makes learning fun and easy. By following the animated stories, students learn to apply the heuristics they have learnt in real-life situations. These animations will be used to create online lesson packages for the students to use as a form of self-directed learning.

The key to problem solving in Greenwood is based on the STAR Strategy. It is a structured strategy for problem-solving that is adapted from Polya’s four-step Model. This strategy is incorporated into the Heuristic Packages for each level and is also the primary strategy that students employ in problem solving.

Another innovative resource proudly developed by Greenwood teachers is the At Home with Math (ATM) series for P1 to P4 students. These ATM booklets consist of weekly sums that parents can use to help their children gain mastery in basic Mathematics concepts and monitor their children’s progress in the learning of Mathematics.

<center>Many skills in Mathematics require some form of drill and practice to be mastered. The ATM questions are designed to provide this in a fun way that promotes family bonding as well.</center>

#### Maths Week

Every year during the Maths week, the Mathematics department teachers and Math monitors work together to plan and carry out various interesting Mathematics activities for all students. These activities help to engage and excite the students and build their confidence in the subject.

#### Journal Writing  
 

In 2021, the Mathematics Department in Greenwood Primary School embarked on mathematics journaling with our students. Through Journaling, students develop reasoning and communication skills and also apply their knowledge in Mathematics. Students are able to consolidate and deepen their understanding of mathematics concepts. Journaling is also a good habit that supports the development of metacognition.

#### Mathemagician

Every student in Greenwood has the opportunity to be a Mathemagician. As Mathemagician, they get to share articles or stories related to mathematics and post questions, puzzles and self-created challenges at the maths corner in their classrooms for a week. In addition, they may also share their reflections on their experience as a Mathemagician. Through this platform, students become more confident in Mathematics and develop affection and a good attitude for the subject.

#### Partnering our Stakeholders  

Every year, the Mathematics department teachers organize workshops for the parents. In these workshops, parents can pick up strategies that they can adopt to engage their children in problem-solving at home. Given the Safe Management Measures (SMM) this year, our school conducted the workshops through the online platform.
