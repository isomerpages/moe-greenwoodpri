<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>A community of passionate MTL learners who have the global mindset and
yet stay rooted</p>
<h3><strong>Mission&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>To build a conducive environment for the teaching and learning of MTL
and establish a team of competent teachers.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programme</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) -Bilingual&nbsp;Literature apprecIation&nbsp;Student’s&nbsp;Series (BLISS)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our ALP-BLISS in Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) aims to help students see
the relevance of learning MTL by applying reasoning and argumentative skills
to construct meaning and opinions linking to societal concerns in the real
world. During BLISS lessons, we equip our pupils with 21st-century skills
to think critically, examine problems, gather information, and make informed
decisions. In the process, students also become more confident speakers
and learners who are able to use MTL more effectively.</p>

analysing themes, understanding character development, exploring literary
devices, and interpreting symbolism.</p>

<h4><strong>School-Based Learning Packages</strong></h4>
<p>The MTL Department prides itself on creating in-house writing, comprehension,
and oral packages to cater to the needs of our students. In class, teachers
use varied strategies to engage the students and make the Mother Tongue
languages fun and interesting.</p>
<h4><strong>Conversational Chinese and Malay</strong></h4>
<p>Selected P3 students attend weekly Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM)
lessons, delivered through face-to-face sessions and the SLS platform.
This programme aims to strengthen Singapore's multi-racial cohesion by
providing students with a basic understanding of a third language. These
skills can be valuable for economic or other purposes in adulthood. By
sharing their newfound knowledge with peers, students enhance social cohesion
within the school community</p>
