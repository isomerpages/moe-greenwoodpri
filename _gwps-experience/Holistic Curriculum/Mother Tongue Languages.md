<center>A community of passionate MTL learners who have the global mindset and yet stay rooted&nbsp;</center>

### <center>Mission&nbsp;</center>

<center>To build a conducive environment for the teaching and learning of MTL and establish a team of competent teachers.</center>

  

#### Key Programme  

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP) -Bilingual&nbsp;Literature apprecIation&nbsp;Student’s&nbsp;Series (BLISS)**

Our ALP - BLISS in Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) aims to help students to see the relevance of learning MTL by applying reasoning and argumentative skills to construct meaning and opinions linking to societal concerns in the real world. During BLISS lessons, we equip our pupils with 21st-century skills to think critically, examine problems, gather information, and make informed decisions. In the process, students also become more confident speakers and learners who are able to use MTL more effectively.

Every year, the MTL Department will organise activities to create an immersive experience leading up to Lunar New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali.

#### School-Based Learning Packages

The MTL Department prides itself in creating in-house writing, comprehension and oral packages to cater to the needs of our students. In class, teachers used varied strategies to engage the students and make the Mother Tongue Languages fun and interesting.
	
#### e-Oral and writing workshop for parents

E-Oral &amp; Writing workshops for P3- P6 parents are conducted annually to equip parents with skills to support their children at home further. The MTL teachers work hand-in-hand with the parents on the usage of Greenwood Primary School’s in-house e-Oral and writing packages. In 2021, the workshop was held virtually via Zoom. Parents were actively engaged in discussion even though it was conducted virtually.
