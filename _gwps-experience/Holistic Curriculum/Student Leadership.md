<center><h3><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h3></center>

<center><strong><h4>Overview</h4></strong></center>

Student leadership plays a pivotal role in fostering the holistic development of students.&nbsp; Our student leadership curriculum is aligned to our school’s mission of nurturing individuals to become lifelong learners and responsible citizens through a well-rounded education, as well as the school’s vision of Motivated Learners, Critical Thinkers, and Leaders of Character. In Greenwood Primary, we envision our student leaders to &nbsp;exemplify our WEGR2O values in their thought and action.

<center><strong><h4>The LEADership Way</h4></strong></center>

Our student leadership’s philosophy L.E.A.D (**Lead** with **Empathy**, **Awareness**, and **Determination**: **The LEADership Way**) is anchored based on the following key beliefs that

* Every Greenwoodian is a leader.
* Leadership training should be developmental and progressive in nature.

Our students can accomplish the following in alignment with the student leadership’s LEAD philosophy.
 

**Student Leadership Framework**

The school has established a leadership structure designed to enhance our student leaders' competencies across four key dimensions: Leaders of Self, Leaders of Others, Leaders of School and Mentors of Others.

Level 1: Leaders of Self

At Level 1, the focus will be on whole school leadership development to build on students’ personal effectiveness. Our CCE in the Woods lessons, where the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People are incorporated, equips students with the 7 habits of highly effective people to help them become leaders of themselves and to understand the kind of leaders they want to be.

Level 2 and 3: Leaders of Others and School

At these levels, the focus will be on providing more specialised development of team leadership through opportunities to work with diverse groups of students. This can occur through classroom group projects, leading through services (Values in Action) and CCA-based leadership.

Level 4: Mentors of School

At Level 4, the EXCO members of the Prefectorial Board will take on the role of mentoring other prefects or leaders and providing coaching and guidance. They will be given more autonomy to plan, initiate and execute certain student-initiated projects and activities.

**LEADon: Structured Student Leadership Plan**

Implementing a three-year student leadership plan in our school for Level 3 and 4 students offers a structured pathway for them to develop and hone their leadership skills throughout their primary school journey.

The training programmes are intentionally planned by adapting from the 5 Exemplary Leadership Practices by Kouzes and Posner to uphold their Leadership Journey.

In Year 1, our focus is on developing and equipping them with relevant communication skills such as listen attentively to their team members, understand and connect with their peers, and offer constructive feedback while being open to receiving it themselves to enhance performance.

In Year 2, we emphasize conflict management through restorative practices. The students will also undergo project management training, where we will focus on four key behaviors of clear communication, team-building, problem-solving, and being adaptable.

By Year 3 (P6), the training shifts towards inspiring and mentoring others, consolidating their leadership skills and preparing them to guide and develop future leaders.
