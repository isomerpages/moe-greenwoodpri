<h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
<p>Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are
some of the key driving forces in a fast changing world. To enable our
students to face the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities of
the future, the school has developed a value-based curriculum which develops
students’ critical and inventive thinking where they apply various thinking
skills and systems to derive alternative solutions and perspectives and
relate to real-life problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy:</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that the critical and inventive thinking skills that one acquires
when he/she is young will ultimately determine his/her level of success
in the future. Thinking habits and systems such as Appreciative Inquiry
(AI), Systems Thinking, Four Player Model, and Design Thinking promote
critical and inventive thinking. These systems require students to have
an intentional process to derive new, relevant solutions that would create
positive impact. As the customised curriculum is values-based, it would
develop our students with some core values and give them the moral compass
to be rooted to Singapore. We believe that early exposure to thinking dispositions
and values-based inquiry would groom our students to be lifelong learners
and prepare them for greater goals in their lives to serve the future of
Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong>Outcomes:</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Implementation:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>CCE in the Woods (CIW)</strong>
</p>
<p>CIW is our school-based values-curriculum developed to educate students
on values and self-leadership skills with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People as a foundation. The CIW package consists of activity sheets, buzz
time and students’ reflection on our school values and the 7 habits.</p>
<p>Through the use Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the Four Player Model and Systems
Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking
and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical
in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will self-assess on their progress in demonstrating
our school values using the CIW Reflection. Thereafter, teachers will provide
their input and feedback to support our students’ character development.</p>

<p><strong>GREEN (Gracious, Responsible, and Environmentally ENgaged) in the Woods (GITW)</strong>
</p>
<p>GITW seeks to nurture our students as future environmental change-makers.
Our environmental education programme, which is intentional and spiral
in approach, aims to heighten environmental awareness and instil in students
a lifelong commitment to care for the environment. GITW pursues this through
four core aspects (Curriculum, Campus, Culture, and Community), focusing
on waste management, energy conservation, water conservation, and biodiversity,
using the 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Replace) approach. Students
are concerned citizens of the environment and strive to become active contributors
by taking proactive steps to make a difference through activities such
as the Clean Plate Campaign, biweekly recycling efforts, and sharing during
assembly programmes.</p>
