<h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
<p>Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are some of the key driving forces in a fast-changing world. To enable our students to face the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities of the future, the school has developed a value-based curriculum undergirded by design thinking principles which develops students’ critical, adaptive and inventive thinking where they apply various thinking skills and systems to derive alternative solutions and perspectives and relate to real-life problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy:</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that the critical and inventive thinking skills that one acquires when he/she is young will ultimately determine his/her level of success in the future. Thinking habits and systems such as Appreciative Inquiry (AI), Systems Thinking, Four Player Model, and Design Thinking promote critical and inventive thinking. These systems require students to have an intentional process to derive new, relevant solutions that would create positive impact. As the customised curriculum is values-based, it would develop our students with some core values and give them the moral compass to be rooted to Singapore. We believe that early exposure to thinking dispositions and values-based inquiry would groom our students to be lifelong learners and prepare them for greater goals in their lives to serve the future of Singapore.</p></center>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CCE in the Woods (CIW)</strong>
</p>
<p>CIW is our school-based values-curriculum developed to educate students on values and self-leadership skills with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a foundation. The CIW package consists of activity sheets, buzz time and students’ reflection on our school values and the 7 habits..</p>
<p>Through the use Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the Four Player Model and Systems Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will self-assess on their progress in demonstrating our school values using the CIW Reflection. Thereafter, teachers will provide their input and feedback to support our students’ character development.</p>
