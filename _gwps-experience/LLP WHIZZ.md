<h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
<p>Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are
some of the key driving forces in a fast changing world. To enable our
students to face the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities of the
future, the school has developed a value-based curriculum which develops
students’ critical and inventive thinking where they apply various thinking
skills and systems to derive alternative solutions and perspectives and
relate to real-life problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy:</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that the critical and inventive thinking skills that one acquires when he/she is young will ultimately determine his/her level of success in the future. Thinking habits and systems such as Appreciative Inquiry (AI), Systems Thinking, Four Player Model, and Design Thinking promote critical and inventive thinking. These systems require students to have an intentional process to derive new, relevant solutions that would create positive impact. As the customised curriculum is values-based, it would develop our students with some core values and give them the moral compass to be rooted to Singapore. We believe that early exposure to thinking dispositions and values-based inquiry would groom our students to be lifelong learners and prepare them for greater goals in their lives to serve the future of Singapore.</p>

<h4><strong>Implementation:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>CCE in the Woods (CIW)</strong>
</p>
<p>CIW is our school-based values-curriculum developed to educate students on values and self-leadership skills with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a foundation. The CIW package consists of activity sheets, buzz time and students’ reflection on our school values and the 7 habits.</p>
<p>Through the use Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the Four Player Model and Systems Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character. </p><p>Additionally, students will self-assess on their progress in demonstrating our school values using the CIW Reflection. Thereafter, teachers will provide their input and feedback to support our students’ character development.</p>
<p><strong>Values in the Woods Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue and Art department staff and pupils have come together
to develop a school based programme to be conducted during CCE lessons.
The values stories are written by MT/CL teachers and are translated into
EL for scaling up to ML and TL versions. Our pupils take the lead in crafting
the scenes and illustrating the stories with characters based on our school
mascot, OWL, in various families of different races living together. This
storyboard is further animated. Through the pupils’ work, they actively
transmit the school values to the student body through authentic satires
happening around them.</p>

<p><strong>Lifeskills Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Lifeskills programme consists of Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP),
7 Habits Lessons and Financial Literacy. Through the 7 Habits lessons,
pupils develop good habits for them to develop their social emotional competencies
and enable them to interact effectively with their peers and others.</p>
<p><strong>Enchanting Experiences in collaboration with Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a community project in collaboration with ACM and Greenwood parents
to engage pupils to learn and appreciate historical bearing on character
development. The school is partnering ACM to design a learning day at the
museum using Design Thinking methodology for the pupils and parents. The
learning experience requires parents’ active participation to co-construct
knowledge and understanding with their children during their 2-hour discovery
journey at the museum. Together with their parents, they would draw perspectives
of how history and culture shape character. They also learn to appreciate
the community and what it is able to offer for their development. For the
year 2014, pupils are required to lead some of the learning activities
for their parents. For the year 2015, student leaders who are involved
in the learning journey in 2014 would take the lead to design the learning
activities for P3 pupils.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA) in collaboration with Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH)</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a community project in collaboration with KTPH as part of service
to the community and at the same time enriches the career education of
our pupils. Each year of the collaboration would be based on a theme –
related to Science and Health Education learning such as digestive system,
circulatory system, muscular and skeletal systems. Once a term, the pupils
in the performing arts CCA would perform for an hour during the visit to
KTPH. After the performance, the hospital would conduct health talks on
the healthy lifestyle and habits that would affect that particular body
system as well as the careers in the health industry pertaining to the
care of that body system.</p>
<p>As part of the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme, our pupils
lead as health ambassadors of the school. They will give talks and share
tips of good health habits to the school community, family members and
the community around us pertaining to the body system in the theme of the
year. We aspire that our pupils would be able to empathise with or inspired
to be future workers in the health industry and serve our aging nation.</p>
