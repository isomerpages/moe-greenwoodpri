<h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
<p>Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are
some of the key driving forces in a fast-changing world. To enable our
students to face the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities of
the future, the school has developed a value-based curriculum undergirded
by design thinking principles which develops students’ critical, adaptive
and inventive thinking where they apply various thinking skills and systems
to derive alternative solutions and perspectives and relate to real-life
problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy:</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that the critical and inventive thinking skills that one acquires
when he/she is young will ultimately determine his/her level of success
in the future. Thinking habits and systems such as Appreciative Inquiry
(AI), Systems Thinking, Four Player Model, and Design Thinking promote
critical and inventive thinking. These systems require students to have
an intentional process to derive new, relevant solutions that would create
positive impact. As the customised curriculum is values-based, it would
develop our students with some core values and give them the moral compass
to be rooted to Singapore. We believe that early exposure to thinking dispositions
and values-based inquiry would groom our students to be lifelong learners
and prepare them for greater goals in their lives to serve the future of
Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CCE in the Woods (CIW)</strong>
<br>CIW is our school-based values-curriculum developed to educate students
on values and self-leadership skills with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People as a foundation. The CIW package consists of activity sheets, buzz
time and students’ reflection on our school values and the 7 habits.</p>
<p>Through the use Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the Four Player Model and Systems
Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking
and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical
in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will self-assess on their progress in demonstrating
our school values using the CIW Reflection. Thereafter, teachers will provide
their input and feedback to support our students’ character development.</p>
<p><strong>Project Work (PW)</strong>
<br>At Greenwood Primary School, <strong>Project Work (PW)</strong> is a cornerstone
of our WHIZZ Programme and a key driver in cultivating critical thinkers
and leaders of character. The school collaborated with Republic Polytechnic
in 2024 to review and enhance the PW curriculum. Anchored in Design Thinking
and aligned with MOE’s Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC), our
PW curriculum engages students in authentic, real-world challenges — preparing
them to be Curious, Confident, and Collaborative problem solvers in a dynamic
global landscape.</p>

<p>Primary 1 and 2 students use food journaling to document family memories.
In 2024, we contributed to the national archival collection, <a href="https://www.singaporememories.gov.sg/Highlight/HighlightCollections?HighlightId=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Makan</a>,
in collaboration with the National Library Board Contemporary Collecting</p>

<p>Primary 3 students design games or toys for family members and friends
to teach a concept through a fun way.</p>

<li>
<p>Primary 4 students raise awareness among seniors and preschool students
in our neighborhood about how they can contribute to making Singapore a
Zero Waste Nation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 5 students work on an entrepreneurship-themed project where they
identify problems faced by real stakeholders, such as local brand Pupsik
and school canteen vendors, and design innovative solutions. They interviewed
the stakeholders to better understand their needs, and eventually created
prototypes like informative marketing campaigns, creative packaging, or
interactive tools to support them by boosting sales or overcoming their
challenges.

<p>Greenwood Primary School’s WHIZZ programme exemplifies its commitment
to nurturing Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character who actively contribute
to their community. Through Project Work and CIW, students learn about
design thinking and apply that to real-life projects. Hence, they develop
students with 21st-century competencies to make a positive impact. The
positive contributions our students make will help them become Critical
Thinkers and Leaders of Character, forming a future-ready generation that
will contribute significantly to society.</p>
