<h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
<p>Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are
some of the key driving forces in a fast-changing world. To enable our
students to face the challenges and capitalise on the opportunities of
the future, the school has developed a value-based curriculum undergirded
by design thinking principles which develops students’ critical, adaptive
and inventive thinking where they apply various thinking skills and systems
to derive alternative solutions and perspectives and relate to real-life
problems.</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy:</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that the critical and inventive thinking skills that one acquires
when he/she is young will ultimately determine his/her level of success
in the future. Thinking habits and systems such as Appreciative Inquiry
(AI), Systems Thinking, Four Player Model, and Design Thinking promote
critical and inventive thinking. These systems require students to have
an intentional process to derive new, relevant solutions that would create
positive impact. As the customised curriculum is values-based, it would
develop our students with some core values and give them the moral compass
to be rooted to Singapore. We believe that early exposure to thinking dispositions
and values-based inquiry would groom our students to be lifelong learners
and prepare them for greater goals in their lives to serve the future of
Singapore.</p></center>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CCE in the Woods (CIW)</strong>
<br>CIW is our school-based values-curriculum developed to educate students
on values and self-leadership skills with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People as a foundation. The CIW package consists of activity sheets, buzz
time and students’ reflection on our school values and the 7 habits.</p>
<p>Through the use Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the Four Player Model and Systems
Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking
and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical
in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will self-assess on their progress in demonstrating
our school values using the CIW Reflection. Thereafter, teachers will provide
their input and feedback to support our students’ character development.</p>
<p><strong>Project Work (PW)</strong>
<br>The school's WHIZZ programme is enacted through the PW programme. This
initiative embodies the school's vision of fostering critical thinkers
through an innovative curriculum. The school collaborates with Republic
Polytechnic to review and enhance this curriculum, ensuring students receive
robust education centred on design thinking and innovation. Two weeks within
the school calendar are designated for Project Work (PW), during which
students apply design thinking to solve real-life community-related problems.
They transfer, apply, and integrate skills and knowledge from different
subjects to create experiments, conduct research, or invent solutions.
Below are the different components of the school’s Project Work:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Curriculum based on Design Thinking Principles:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The school’s PW curriculum is designed around the principles of design
thinking. Students learn to approach problems creatively, empathise with

</li>
<li>
<p>By applying design thinking, students acquire essential 21st-century competencies,
including critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA) Projects:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>

in collaboration with the National Library Board Contemporary Collecting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 3 students reimagine and design school spaces to enhance the learning
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 4 students take action by designing games or toys for competitions
and the annual Celebrating OWLETS event, promoting social entrepreneurship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 5 students increase awareness of health benefits, such as eating
mushrooms, through partnerships with organisations like Golden Cap Farm,
while serving other partners such as the Day Centres for Seniors and the
Preschools in our neighbourhood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Celebrating Owlets - Project Showcase</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Students have opportunities to present their final project outcomes to
their peers and teachers in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The culmination of these efforts is showcased at the school’s annual Celebrating
Owlets event, where completed projects are displayed in booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through this platform, students acquire essential 21st-century competencies

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Greenwood Primary School’s WHIZZ programme exemplifies its commitment
to nurturing Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character who actively contribute
to their community. Through the Project Work and CIW, students learn about
design thinking and apply that to real-life projects. Hence, they develop
students develop 21st-century competencies and make a positive impact.
The positive contributions our students make will help them become Critical
Thinkers and Leaders of Character, forming a future generation that will
contribute significantly to society.</p>
