<p>Our school aims to make learning a DELIGHT-FUL journey through instilling
the joy of learning with hands-on and authentic learning experiences.</p>
<p>Our efforts are centered on strengthening the foundation of young learners
(lower primary students) by fostering in them a positive attitude towards
learning and equipping them with skills to develop into lifelong learners.</p>
<p><strong>Our Beliefs</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every child can learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every child can be inspired to become lifelong learners if they experience
the joy of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every child should be provided with the opportunity to experience different
types of learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our areas of focus to strengthen foundations of lower primary students:<br>Laying the Foundation Well at Primary 1 and Primary 2</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Build a strong foundation for lifelong learning, starting from pre-school

<p><strong>Reimagining learning space</strong>
</p>
<p>To promote literacy and learning and enhance accessibility for lower primary
students, the school revamped and created a new lower primary library.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>“Wonder in the Woods” Library features:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Collaborative Space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading Space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-expression Space</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond serving as a space for exploration and the quenching of curiosity,
the library also stands as a haven for contemplation. It provides visitors
with an opportunity to pause, reflect, and glean insights from their exploratory
journeys and adventures.</p>
