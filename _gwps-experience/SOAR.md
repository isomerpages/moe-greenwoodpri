<center><h3><strong>Stretching One’s Abilities &amp; Readiness</strong></h3></center><strong>
<p>SOAR is undergirded by the strong belief of a holistic education and every
child matters. Besides providing additional support to our lower progressing
students, we believe that it is important to understand the needs of our
higher progressing students to support their holistic growth.</p>
<h4><strong></strong><center><strong>Our Aim</strong></center></h4>
<p>To provide a structure to stretch our students’ thinking and maximise
their potential in learning throughout their six years of education here.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><center>Our Objectives</center></strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Identify the learning needs and profiles of HP students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw out a framework which defines how HP students are developed holistically
in GWPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design or adapt programmes or pedagogies that stretch HP students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide avenues to maximise HP students’ potential.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><center>Framework</center></strong></h4>
<p>We adopt the Renzulli’s Enrichment Triad Model to guide the planning of
SOAR programme. The Enrichment Triad Model was designed to encourage the
creative productivity of young people by exposing them to various topics,
areas of interest, and fields of study, and to further train them to apply
advanced content, process-training skills, and methodology training to
self-selected areas of interest. SOAR seeks to expose students to various
topics, guide students through their areas of interest and to further develop
them in their talented areas. Enrichment programmes in the academic and
non-academic subjects are planned in a 3-Type approach for students to
be adequately challenged so that passions are nurtured and enthusiasms
are sustained.</p>
<p>In Greenwood Primary School, the teachers followed a three-typed approach
in the planning of programmes to meet the learning needs of our HP students.
In Type 1, we plan programmes to expose students to a wide variety of disciplines,
topics, occupations, hobbies, persons, places, and events that would not
ordinarily be covered in the regular curriculum. (eg. inviting external
speakers at assemblies, learning journey and museum visits etc)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Type 2, we plan programmes and pedagogies/strategies adopted that consists
of materials and methods designed to promote the development of thinking
and feeling processes. (eg. BLISS (ALP) and WHIZZ (LLP) programme etc)
The programmes in Type 2 are helmed by the various departments, BLISS and
Project Work Team.</p>
<p>In Type 3, we plan programmes to develop a small group of selected students
(HP) to maximise their learning potential. (eg. E2K, STEM in the Woods,
Think Tank etc)</p>

<h4><strong><center>Approach</center></strong></h4>
<p>Identifying “higher progressing” (HP) students helps teachers to meet
their learning needs. The key principles to be considered during the identification
of higher progressing students are to have different measures and to be
flexible and continuous (Richert, 1991).</p>
