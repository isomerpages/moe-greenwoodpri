<h4><strong>Rationale:</strong></h4>
<p>In Greenwood Primary School, our vision is to develop students into motivated
learners, critical thinkers and leaders of character. We recognise the
diversity of our student profiles and we focus on developing their thinking
skills by providing them with opportunities to stretch themselves. Since 2022, we have implemented the SOAR Programme to address the diverse needs and abilities of our students. This includes a framework to challenge
our students’ thinking and optimise their potential in learning throughout
their six years of education here.</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy:</strong></h4>
<p>The school adopts Renzulli's Enrichment Triad Model to guide the planning
of the SOAR programme. This model aims to foster the creative productivity
of young people by exposing them to various topics, areas of interest,
and fields of study, and by training them to apply advanced content, process
skills, and methods to their self-selected areas of interest. SOAR seeks
to expose students to various topics, guide them through their areas of
interest, and further develop their talents. Enrichment programmes in both
academic and non-academic subjects are planned in a three-type approach
to challenge students appropriately and nurture their passions and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Type 1 programmes expose students to a wide variety of disciplines, topics,
occupations, hobbies, persons, places, and events that spark their curiosity
and interest.</p>
<p>Type 2 programmes and pedagogies/strategies use materials and methods
that promote the development of thinking and feeling processes, such as
critical thinking, creative thinking, and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Type 3 programmes cater to a small group of selected students (High Ability
Learners) who have demonstrated high levels of interest and ability in
a specific area, and provide them with opportunities to pursue their passion
and develop their talents.</p>
