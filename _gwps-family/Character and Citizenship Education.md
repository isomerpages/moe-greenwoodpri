Vision  

Citizens of good character who are rooted to Singapore

Mission

To nurture responsible citizens who are leaders of character.

  

Key Programmes  

**Character Education through Intellectual Discourse (CareIn)**  

CareIn is a school-based curriculum designed to instil school values and citizenry in our students. It aims to build SEL competencies in them as they engage in discussions on contemporary issues that affect them and the society. Using Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the 4 Player Model and Systems Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character. 

  

**Life Skills (LS)**  

The Life Skills Programme aims to equip students with life skills and build their leadership competencies to nurture them into motivated learners. It brings together three programmes: The Student Leadership, Financial Literacy and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).

**Student Leadership**

The school has a tiered approach in building leadership competency in our students. Tier 1 represents leadership opportunities for all students where they go through the Leader in Me programme which equips them with 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to nurture them into motivated learners. In Tier 2, students who have taken up leadership roles in class committees are trained in their new role to develop their leadership skills. Prefects and CCA leaders form Tier 3 and they go through a modular training to hone their leadership competencies in the four areas of Relating, Sense-making, Visioning and Inventing in the Leadership Framework which is adapted from the Leadership Framework developed by MIT Leadership Centre. Student leaders also go through situational assessment to evaluate their growth in the leadership competencies. Teachers then work with the student leaders to identify the areas that they can focus on for their personal growth and development.
