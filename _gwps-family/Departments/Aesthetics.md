#### Art Trail & Exhibition

Art Trail and Exhibition aim to give voice to our students by creating platforms for them to display their artworks on three different levels: the classroom, the school, and the community. In the process, students learn how artworks can be a vessel of their expressions and beliefs.

**<center>Students’ Engaging in learning</center>**

Students would have creative and innovative self-expression opportunities in the six years of learning in Greenwood Primary through various mediums. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. The engagement in art discussions in the curriculum promotes a lifelong enjoyment and an appreciation for artistic works, developing visual literacy in our students. The production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise.
