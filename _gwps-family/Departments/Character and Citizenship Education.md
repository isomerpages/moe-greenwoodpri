### <center>Mission</center>

<center>To nurture responsible citizens who are leaders of character.</center>

#### **Key Programmes  **

**Character Education through Intellectual Discourse (CareIn)**  

CareIn is a school-based curriculum designed to instil school values and citizenry in our students. It aims to build SEL competencies in them as they engage in discussions on contemporary issues that affect them and the society. Using Appreciative Inquiry (AI), the 4 Player Model and Systems Thinking (Upper Primary), teachers engage students in critical thinking and guide them in developing their own moral compass. This is critical in developing our students into Critical Thinkers and Leaders of Character. 

**Life Skills (LS)**  

The Life Skills Programme aims to equip students with life skills and build their leadership competencies to nurture them into motivated learners. It brings together three programmes: The Student Leadership, Financial Literacy and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).

**Student Leadership**

The school has a tiered approach in building leadership competency in our students. Tier 1 represents leadership opportunities for all students where they go through the Leader in Me programme which equips them with 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to nurture them into motivated learners. In Tier 2, students who have taken up leadership roles in class committees are trained in their new role to develop their leadership skills. Prefects and CCA leaders form Tier 3 and they go through a modular training to hone their leadership competencies in the four areas of Relating, Sense-making, Visioning and Inventing in the Leadership Framework which is adapted from the Leadership Framework developed by MIT Leadership Centre. Student leaders also go through situational assessment to evaluate their growth in the leadership competencies. Teachers then work with the student leaders to identify the areas that they can focus on for their personal growth and development.

**Financial Literacy Programme**

Financial Literacy is a school-based curriculum aimed at equipping our students with the necessary skills and knowledge to make better financial decisions. It is never too young to be financially prudent, and the programme seeks to educate students on the importance of saving, differentiating needs from wants and getting them to be involved in planning their budget.

**Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) programme**

FTGP seeks to deepen the Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) and equip students with social and emotional competencies. It serves as a platform for teachers to interact and understand their students and for students to pick up important life skills to overcome challenges. It also creates time and space for students to have meaningful interactions with their teachers and for teachers to seize teachable moments to impart life skills beyond the academic domain.

  

**Values in Action (VIA)**  

In nurturing our students to be Leaders of Character, the VIA programme provides them with opportunities to contribute to society. The school believes that every student, no matter how young, can contribute to society.

The programme focuses on the three areas of Awareness, Action and Advocacy which are aimed at improving the well-being of the community. Students plan and execute a VIA programme, which is integrated with Project Work (PW), at least twice in their six years in Greenwood Primary School and raise funds for at least one Institution of A Public Character (IPC).

Students in Primary 1, 2 and 3 work on ways to contribute to the community by raising awareness on issues that matter to them. Students in Primary 4, take action through our annual Celebrating OWLETS event which serves as a platform for social entrepreneurship and to raise funds for an IPC. Primary 5 students take action and become advocates on important issues such as Active Ageing, Clean & Green and promoting SMART nation initiatives. Students become Leaders of Character as they influence and shape the thinking of others as they work with external stakeholders such as the elderly care centres and preschools in the community.
