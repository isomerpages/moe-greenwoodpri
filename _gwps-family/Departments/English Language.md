### <center>Vision

<center>Confident and competent readers who love the English language

### <center>Mission

To enhance the joy of learning English through quality teaching and learning 
  At GWPS, we develop students who love the language by first inculcating a love for reading through our extensive reading programmes
 
##### Read @ Greenwood  

**Book Buzz in the Woods**

Teachers role model reading to students. Through Book Buzz in the Woods, teachers share their favourite book to motivate and encourage students to read.

**Avid Readers**

The department has designed a set of reading activities for each block of students. Students choose activities to complete in their Avid Readers book. After completion, they proudly get to claim their reading badge.  

  

**Guest Reader**

Lower primary students enjoy the experience of having a special guest in their classroom who reads aloud a book to them every month

The friendly librarian visits every classroom fortnightly to share on authors and promote books. Students get to borrow these books on the spot.

**Students‘ Caught Reading’  **

Students ‘caught reading’ outside their classrooms are awarded reading badges. These badges serve to build enthusiasm around reading by getting kids talking about the books they love
