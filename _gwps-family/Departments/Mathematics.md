**Vision**

Confident Thinkers, Competent and Excellent Problem Solvers

Mission 

To instil in students the love for Mathematics and help them attain a level of mastery in problem-solving skills that will serve them well in life.

  

Learning Experiences in the classrooms  

In Greenwood, students learn Mathematics in a fun and interactive manner so that they become confident and life-long learners of the subject. We believe that students must have opportunities to hone their reasoning and communication skills in their Mathematics classrooms. This is achieved by providing students with Learning Experiences that allows them to:  

  

1)Experience Early Success  

2)Build a Strong Foundation

3)Make Steady Progress

Strategies adopted by the department to provide an engaging learning experiences:

  

<center>a) Learning through Games</center>

<center>Heuristics in the Woods using STAR Strategy</center>

  

Heuristics in the Woods is an innovative teaching and learning resource that Greenwood teachers and students created. This resource makes use of stories and animation to teach heuristics in an exciting way. It makes learning fun and easy. By following the animated stories, students learn to apply the heuristics they have learnt in real-life situations. These animations will be used to create online lesson packages for the students to use as a form of self-directed learning.

The key to problem solving in Greenwood is based on the STAR Strategy. It is a structured strategy for problem-solving that is adapted from Polya’s four-step Model. This strategy is incorporated into the Heuristic Packages for each level and is also the primary strategy that students employ in problem solving.
