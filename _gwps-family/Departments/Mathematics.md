**Vision**

Confident Thinkers, Competent and Excellent Problem Solvers

Mission 

To instil in students the love for Mathematics and help them attain a level of mastery in problem-solving skills that will serve them well in life.

  

Learning Experiences in the classrooms  

In Greenwood, students learn Mathematics in a fun and interactive manner so that they become confident and life-long learners of the subject. We believe that students must have opportunities to hone their reasoning and communication skills in their Mathematics classrooms. This is achieved by providing students with Learning Experiences that allows them to:  

  

1)Experience Early Success  

2)Build a Strong Foundation

3)Make Steady Progress
