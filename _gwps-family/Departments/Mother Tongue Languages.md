Vision

A community of passionate MTL learners who have the global mindset and yet stay rooted 

  

Mission 

To build a conducive environment for the teaching and learning of MTL and establish a team of competent teachers.

  

Key Programme  

  

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP) -Bilingual Literature apprecIation Student’s Series (BLISS)**

Our ALP - BLISS in Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) aims to help students to see the relevance of learning MTL by applying reasoning and argumentative skills to construct meaning and opinions linking to societal concerns in the real world. During BLISS lessons, we equip our pupils with 21st-century skills to think critically, examine problems, gather information, and make informed decisions. In the process, students also become more confident speakers and learners who are able to use MTL more effectively.
