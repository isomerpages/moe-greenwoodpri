### VISION

Critical thinkers with a passion to learn and a concern for the environment.
  
### MISSION

To nurture students to have a curious mind and a desire to learn.

To equip students with the skills to carry out critical and innovative thinking. 

 To develop in students, a concern for the environment.

	
#### **KEY PROGRAMMES**

**Teaching and Learning**

Science department believes in deepening the Inquiry approach and the 5E (Evaluate, Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) approach through the various engaging and enriching Science lessons. We want to deepen these skills through Hinge Point Questioning and the Error Analysis approach where we would enable students to ask questions and build their critical thinking skills. Strategies such as RISSA and RISES help them further hone their thinking process when they encounter Science Questions.

**Eureka! With Parents**  

This programme aims to fuel the curiosity in our students  through scientific inquiry by relating Science concepts acquired from school to the real world. We bring Science alive and make it  relevant and meaningful for our students through Eureka! With Parents. This programme allows parents to explore Science with their children during the school holidays. Here are some real life discoveries shared by our students  and their parents which have been featured in our Eureka with Parents book.

**Science Whizz Kids**

This programme provides students with an opportunity to showcase their talent and develop their potential in Science. The programme aims to provide students  with the opportunity to deepen their learning and stimulate their curiosity in the role played by Science in our everyday life. Through this process, students gain 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

**1)Science Sparks**  

Students have different opportunities to hone their talents and interests in Science.  This programme provides experiential learning through inquiry to build P1 and P2 students' interest towards the learning of Science. Through the experience, students learn interesting Science concepts, have greater awareness of environmental issues and develop their Science thinking skills.

**2)Science Olympiad programme and Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science**  

The Science Olympiad programme (Primary 3-5) and Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science (Primary 4 &5) are for selected students who not only possess a talent for Science but also display interest in learning new Science concepts. These programmes go beyond the Primary Science curriculum and promote open inquiry and higher order thinking skills in students.

**3)Young Scientist Cards (online)**  

In this programme, students are given an opportunity to engage in hands-on tasks and learn Science in a fun manner through everyday scenarios. It provides opportunities for students to deepen their learning and to stimulate their creativity. It aims to develop students into concerned citizens, active contributors and self-directed learners.

**GREEN in the Woods (Gracious, Responsible & Environmentally Engaged in the Woods)**

The GREEN in the Woods programme seeks to establish and sustain a positive environmental culture through encouraging and practising environmentally responsible behaviour in the aspect of 4Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle and Replace).

Throughout the year, key programmes and innovations are planned and organised to shape the beliefs of students and staff on the importance of protecting the environment. Our programmes focus on student-led initiatives and student involvement in green movement activities such as recycling projects, food waste reduction, lessons in green spaces, dengue education, water and electricity conservation, and commemorative events such as Earth Day and World Water Day.

In addition, our students also participate actively in outreach programmes organised by external agencies such as Northwest CDC, NEA and NParks. Partnership with the community gives them an opportunity to engage and work collaboratively with others to conserve our environment and create environmental awareness. Accreditations from the Northwest CDC, Singapore Environment Council, Building and Constructions Authority (BCA) and World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) have affirmed the school’s good practices.
