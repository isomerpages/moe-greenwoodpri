The Co-Curriculum is integral to the holistic development of our students and is an important aspect of the Greenwood schooling experience. Through Co-curriculum Activities (CCA), students are given opportunities to discover their interests and talents, as well as to develop character, skillsets, and the 21st century competencies.  

In Greenwood, we offer a range of CCAs in Physical Sports, Visual & Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs & Societies.
