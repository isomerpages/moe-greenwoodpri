<h4><strong>UPLIFT: Empowering Holistic Development for Future-Ready Students</strong></h4>
<p>UPLIFT is an initiative dedicated to enhancing the well-being and holistic
development of our disadvantaged students. It aims to create a nurturing
environment that supports every aspect of a student's growth, ensuring
they are well-prepared for the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The school designs specialized programmes to support the development of
these students. The program is designed to be hands-on, fun, and engaging
while also instilling good values and resilience. The programmes include:</p>

<p>Through UPLIFT, we are committed to creating a supportive and inclusive
educational environment that empowers every student to reach their full

students, we can uplift them and ensure they are ready to face the future
with confidence and resilience. We also believe in cultivating proactive
and strategic partnerships with the community to support the schoolâ€™s efforts.</p>
